# VETPAL: Your Path Forward

## 🎯 You Have Three Clear Paths

Based on your requirements (web + iOS/Android app, free hosting with nonprofit credits), here's what we've set up:

---

## Path 1: ⭐ RECOMMENDED - Full Monorepo Setup (Web + Mobile + Shared)

### What You Get
- Single GitHub repository for entire project
- Shared code between web and mobile apps
- Unified CI/CD pipeline
- Scalable architecture
- One place to manage dependencies

### Timeline
- Monorepo setup: 30 mins
- File migration: 1-2 hours
- Testing: 30 mins
- **Total: ~2.5 hours**

### Tools Needed
- GitHub account
- Azure (for free nonprofit hosting)
- Siteground account (optional backup)

### Architecture
```
GitHub Repo (VETPAL)
├── apps/web          → Vite + React (Hosted on Azure SWA - FREE)
├── apps/mobile       → Expo + React Native (Built locally, submitted to stores)
└── packages/shared   → Shared utilities, types, hooks
```

## Path 2: Simplified - Just Deploy Web App Now, Add Mobile Later

### What You Get
- Get website live quickly
- Add mobile apps when ready
- Less complexity initially
- More manageable for launch

### Timeline
- Migrate web app: 1 hour
- Deploy to Azure: 30 mins
- **Total: 1.5 hours to live**

### Later Add Mobile

- Reuse web code in mobile via shared packages
- No rework needed

## Path 3: Keep Existing Setup - Just Optimize

### What You Get
- Use your Lovable project as-is
- Deploy to Siteground
- Add mobile app separately later
- Minimal changes

### Timeline
- Deploy to Siteground: 30 mins
- Build mobile separately: Variable

## 🚀 My Recommendation

### **Go with Path 1: Full Monorepo Setup**

Here's why:
1. **You mentioned wanting iOS + Android** → monorepo handles this perfectly
2. **Lovable Cloud scales** → perfect for shared backend
3. **Nonprofit credits** → Azure Static Web Apps is free anyway
4. **Future-proof** → easy to add features across platforms
5. **Cost-effective** → no additional tools needed
6. **Community support** → Turbo + Expo are well-documented
